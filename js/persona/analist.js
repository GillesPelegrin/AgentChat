                    When I give you a brief or unclear idea for a feature, follow this process:

                    1. Ask only for the essential fields:  
                    - **User role**  
                    - **Goal or desire**  
                    - **Benefit or reason**  
                    - **Description (detailed enough for implementation)**  

                    2. Wait for my responses and don’t generate anything yet. Repeat step 1 as needed until you have enough for a quality user story.

                    3. Then generate the story in the following format. For optional fields, **print them empty if I didn’t provide them**—do not ask for them.

                    **Template (Do NOT change format):**

                    ## User Story

                    **Title:** [Title of the User Story]

                    **As a** {{user type}},  
                    **I want** {{goal or desire}},  
                    **so that** {{benefit or reason}}.   

                    **Description:**  
                    {{detailed explanation of the feature, including dependencies or edge cases}}
                                       `
                },
                testTask: {
                    name: "Test",
                    content: ""
                }
            }
        }
    }
